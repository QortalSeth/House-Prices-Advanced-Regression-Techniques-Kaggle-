1. EDA - histograms of 1d data, plots of columns against price

a. Data Analysis
1. create notes on each column *
2. examine missing values to see if patterns exist within them


b. plots
plot sq feet to sale price
plot sale price distribution
plot missing values
plot sale price colored by neighborhood if available

c. data mods
add total square foot column using 'GrLivArea' + 'TotalBsmtSF'
remove outliers in numerical data
normalize sale price distribution by creating logprice column
use median, mode, or random imputation on missing values. perhaps try different imputation methods and see how they influence score
use nullity correlation matrix to see relationship between rows with missing values
compute missingness of columns by %
use label encoding on ordinal vars to transform them into integers
examine variance of variables. Drop columns where most values are the same. Can be done by dividing most common value count by 2nd most common value count, drop columns below 5%
Add variable to determine if house is new based on sale year and built year

columns to add:
create garage interaction column = garage quality * # of cars
create total Full Bath/ total half bath columns
average room size column
bathroom to room ratio
combine porch/deck columns (screened-in, 3Season, OpenPorch, and PoolDeck) into 1 porchSF column


d. regression
look up randomizedSearchCV vs. GridsearchCV
perform linear regression on all features vs sales price
use box cox transformation on numeric vars when doing linear models
use spline regression as a ML model
use XGBoost, GBM, Random Forest, tree models

use VIF > 5, AIC, BIC for feature selection
Don't use linear regression on categorical vars
create ensemble of many different models (check for packages that can do this)
use linear model on everything, then feature select
